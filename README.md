`npm install`

To run a development build and launch the android app, execute:

`npm start`

## How it works
To communicate with the game, press the spacebar. It is only when you press it that the game listens.
The player can navigate around the grid by saying right, left, down, or up.
If you say the name of any color, the grid blocks will change to that color!
You can also greet and thank people.

## Tips
Speech recognition might be unreliable at times. As a result, try to talk clearly so that Talky-Blocky can comprehend what you’re saying!
Don’t be afraid to mix commands. “Could you go right for me, Block-Talks, then down, down again, down again, take a left, and turn that block pink for me?”
